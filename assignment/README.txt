-----When writing text in paragraph make sure to use lorem text i.e. type loremX + enter; 
        x is the number of letter example "lorem23" will give:

        Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nulla, mollitia voluptatum! Quam,
        reprehenderit excepturi. Necessitatibus tenetur ducimus esse architecto vero.

------Use "test_pic1" in all images (test_pic is for the homepage background)

GOALS
    + Focus on semantics
    + Make it accessible
    + Clean & Readable code


NOTE*

logo, sitename and type of club (academic, sports, social) has yet to be decided

in index.html we have a big univeristy picture
but in other pages we don't need that so in css there are two header codes
one for homepage and other for all other pages
same with nav
these css codes have to be refactored* 
refactoring -> organizng css codes to improve readability and keep the code DRY


the header (excpet homepage ) and footer are same in all page so we can
create reusable components once all the pages are created 


change all image to webp or jpg xr

change all divs if possible to semantic tags from w3schools



desgin the blogs search button like footer newlsetter
    when user enters a keyword 
        js will search through all the articles and if finds the word in that article
        skip it else display:none again if all display none error not found


consider this header put JOIN US button in ul and edit the css
